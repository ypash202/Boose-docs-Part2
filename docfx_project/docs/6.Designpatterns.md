# Design Patterns Used
Used three design patterns in this project:

1. Factory Pattern

Used to create commands based on input.

BOOSE reads a line like circle 20

The factory returns the correct class
(CircleCommand, MoveToCommand, etc.)

2. Singleton Pattern

Shared structures like the program store exist only once.

Example:

ProgramStore.Instance

3. Additional Design pattern: Command Pattern
The Command Pattern, a behavioural design pattern, is used to encapsulate each BOOSE instruction (such as moveto and drawto) as an object implementing the ICommand interface. The MyStoredProgram class stores these command objects and executes them sequentially. The ExecutionContext acts as the receiver, maintaining the program state and providing the necessary context for command execution. This approach improves modularity, extensibility, and separation of concerns.

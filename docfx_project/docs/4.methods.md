# User Defined Methods
Added full support for creating and calling methods.
Methods allow you to reuse BOOSE code and return values.

1. Method Example
method int mulMethod int one, int two
    mulMethod = one * two
end method

call mulMethod 10 5
write mulMethod

2. Combining methods with drawing

Methods can now calculate numbers and use them in shapes.

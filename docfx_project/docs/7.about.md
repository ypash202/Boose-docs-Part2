The interpreter now includes:

Full BOOSE language execution

Variables, arrays and expressions

Loops and branching

User-defined functions

Automated unit testing

Object-oriented design principles

Clean code documentation

GitHub repository with version history

A published DocFX static reference site

Through this process, the student gained practical experience with:

Parsing code and storing execution context

Building a mini language interpreter from scratch

Applying multiple software design patterns

Debugging and validating code using tests

Presenting technical work clearly
